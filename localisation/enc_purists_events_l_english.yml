enc.0.t:0 "Enclave Remnants Take Over Sierra Military Depot!"
enc.0.d:0 "Enclave Remnants have always flocked to New Reno. Safe from the prying eyes of the NCR, the city always needs muscle and never asks questions. We always assumed their spirits too broken to be a threat. It appears we were wrong, as Enclave remnants from everywhere in the wastes have flocked to the banner of an ageing drill sergeant."
enc.0.a:0 "All according to plan."
enc.0.a.tt:0 "Play as §YThe Enclave§!"
enc.0.b:0 "Not this again!"

enc.1.b:0 "Escaped using Vertibirds."
enc.1.c:0 "Deserted before the fighting got bad."
 #######################################################################################
enc.2.t:0 "Operational Security Compromised!"
enc.2.d:0 "Mr. President, we are hearing disturbing reports of NCR radio chatter in reference to our facilities. We have also received one report of an NCR spy stumbling into one of our conference rooms, completely unaware of where exactly he was. Needless to say, the NCR is sure to notice something is terribly wrong if we don’t act now. Continuing to operate as normal may have dire consequences."
enc.2.a:0 "The time has come."

enc.3.t:0 "Our President"
enc.3.d:0 "Sergeant Dornan is well respected by both the Reformer and Purist faction within the Enclave. None the less, neither see him as a viable president and have presented their own candidates. The Purists have selected Franklin Anderson as their candidate while the reformers are lead by Douglas Granite. It appears the Purist faction has the advantage, but the support of the Sarge could still tip the scales in favour of the reformers."
enc.3.a:0 "Sergeant Dornan supports Franklin Anderson."

enc.6.a:0 "I understand."
########################################################################################
enc.7.t:0 "Dealing with Mordinos"
enc.7.d:0 "The Mordinos long represented the status quo of New Reno. That is to say, criminality, exploitation, drugs and misery. They had many allies but no friends and few are now willing to lay their lives down in defense of the drug lords. We may strike quickly and expect only limited resistance, but some have suggested that we should use the Mordinos to demonstrate we are serious about our Old World values."
enc.7.a:0 "They will be tried in a court of law."

enc.9.d:0 "Doctor Franklin is a former member of the Enclave's Chemical Corps. The good doctor has recently escaped from thirty years of imprisonment and servitude as first a non-person prisoner in Shady Sands' darkest hole, then a slave to a tribe, then a slave in New Reno. Since his return to freedom he has championed the ideals of the Enclave of old; Purity, Supremacy and the Re-establishment of America. Formerly involved in several secret projects during the Presidency of Dick Richardson-notably the FEV Experiments of Mariposa and the creation of Frank Horrigan-he seeks to finish what he and his colleagues started four decades ago: the eradication of the mutant menace that dares to tread upon American soil. When he was a young scientist, he distinguished himself as he... "
enc.9.a:0 "Stared down a rampaging Frank Horrigan until he could be subdued."
enc.9.a.tt: "While the tranquilizers shot into Frank Horrigan were also taking their toll, none can deny that the towering beast of a man stopped his rampage when faced with a young scientist staring back at him without a hint of fear."
enc.9.b:0 "Pioneered a new composition of the common Stimpak via self testing."
enc.9.b.tt: "True devotion to science is measured in sacrifice. This man's risks inspire any scientist."
enc.9.c:0 "Sought out test subjects for the Chemical Corps on the mainland."
enc.9.c.tt: "Most scientists leave the dirty work to the soldiers, but Anderson often accompanied them to the mainland. Sharing in their company and dangers."

enc.11.t:0 "Anderson's Escape"
enc.11.d:0 "Whilst a slave, Anderson was kept from most physical labor duo to his knowledge of chemistry. Able to turn rudimentary scavenged items into poisons and bombs, he was deemed useful by his captors. Years later, when age started taking its toll on Anderson, they decided to bring him to New Reno, hoping the Mordinos would be interested in an old but chemically gifted slave. Much to their surprise, when the party neared New Reno, he..."

enc.16.t:0 "In the lair of the Bear"
enc.16.d:0 "We are on the very borders of the NCR, a rogue nation occupying American soil. We can not deny that they would destroy us if they became fully aware of our existence. Luckily for us, the bear is blind. Weakened by bureaucracy, infighting and an ineffectual leader. With the right efforts made, we can hide under the very nose of the NCR until we are strong enough to reveal our plans. But we cannot keep them in the shadows forever, it will become harder and harder to conceal ourselves as time goes on."
enc.16.a:0 "Our time will come soon."
enc.16.a.tt:0 "Unlocks the §YHide Activities from NCR§! decision.\nThis allows you to spend £pol_power §YPolitical Power§! to keep the NCR from mobilizing against you.\nThe cost of this decision will increase by 10 £pol_power §YPolitical Power§! every time you use it!"

enc.21.d: "It appears one of our Vertibird Assault Teams is going out of their way to inflict collatoral damage on mutants during their patrols, going as far as tallying a count on their vertibird. While their actions could risk the Operational Security of the Enclave, punishing them may prove an unpopular move considering our current stance on mutants."

enc.22.d: "Rumors have begun spreading that a respected administrator of ours is half mutant. Like many of our younger personnel, he was born years after the fall of Navarro to a surviving Enclave soldier and a mysteriously absent mother. If these allegations are true, he may be a serious risk to our security. "

enc.25.d: "With the first squad super mutants taken care of, our team approaches the target of this expeditions. The glowing green vats of FEV are right where we left them, though many of the cases are damaged. The FEV in these vats contaminated beyond belief, they would not be suitable for our research.\n With more super mutants on their heels, our team must decide what to do quickly."

enc.26.a: "Eureka!"
################################################################################################################ -<
enc.27.t: "Cloning Failure!"
enc.27.d: "Our most recent experimentation in creating human clones has resulted in a less than ideal outcome.

enc.31.d: "Mister President, as you are reading this communication, Enclave troops are marching through the 'capital city' of the mutant empire of the NCR.

Our borders now connect us to a horde of mutants perhaps more terrible than any of our old enemies. Caesar's Legion, a parody of pre-war history, defiles our soil with their very existence. It is only a matter of time before their dictator understands the true nature of our goals and once more we will meet a mutant menace on the battlefield."

The lady of Rio, Valentina Rosado, turns American technology against us. The psychic freak of [ATE.GetName] plans to see her people through the storm.

No, we must find somewhere safer; the moon, Mars, or, perhaps, beyond. The Enclave is merely fulfilling its original directive by taking the steps needed to escape from this dying world and its mutant squalor. \n\nThere are several facilities across the Wastes that will encourage the offworld exodus. There is a space shuttle in San Francisco we can liberate; a rocket facility outside Las Vegas we can repair; and, of course, the Bloomfield Space Center. Control of these facilities will accelerate the Great Work. \n\nFor now, we may construct a temporary launch site and begin transferring equipment to orbit.

The liquid hydrocarbons of Titan. The metals of the the asteroid belt. And the limitless, clean energy of the sun. No, our radioactive world is left to our robot servants.

enc.63.d: "The abundance of non-spoilable military rations scattered across what remains of the USA has always been of vital importance to the Enclave. The hydroponic facilities at our bases are not always able to keep up to demand and we hardly have the manpower to send out to tilt the fields.\n\nThis leave us at the mercy of the logistics officers of 200 years ago, however, and it appears some form of mislabeling has resulted in the Sierra Army depot being stocked with a century's supply of hard Russian cheeses.\n\nA recent power surge has damaged one of our hydroponic harvest and since then, the hard Russian cheese has been served with breakfast, lunch and dinner every single day. This has caused some disguntled personel, chief among them lead scientist Thomas Kesselhut, to accuse the cooks of a lack of skill and creativity and demand we ban the Russian cheese."
