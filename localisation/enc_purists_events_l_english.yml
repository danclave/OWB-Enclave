enc.0.t:0 "Enclave Remnants Take Over Sierra Military Depot!"
enc.0.d:0 "Enclave Remnants have always flocked to New Reno. Safe from the prying eyes of the NCR, the city always needs muscle and never asks questions. We always assumed their spirits too broken to be a threat. It appears we were wrong, as Enclave remnants from everywhere in the wastes have flocked to the banner of an ageing drill sergeant."
enc.0.a:0 "All according to plan."

enc.2.d:0 "Mr. President, we are hearing disturbing reports of NCR radio chatter in reference to our facilities. We have also received one report of an NCR spy stumbling into one of our conference rooms, completely unaware of where exactly he was. Needless to say, the NCR is sure to notice something is terribly wrong if we don’t act now. Continuing to operate as normal may have dire consequences."

enc.3.t:0 "Our President"
enc.3.d:0 "Sergeant Dornan is well respected by both the Reformer and Purist faction within the Enclave. None the less, neither see him as a viable president and have presented their own candidates. The Purists have selected Franklin Anderson as their candidate while the reformers are lead by Douglas Granite. It appears the Purist faction has the advantage, but the support of the Sarge could still tip the scales in favour of the reformers."

enc.7.t:0 "Dealing with Mordinos"
enc.7.d:0 "The Mordinos long represented the status quo of New Reno. That is to say, criminality, exploitation, drugs and misery. They had many allies but no friends and few are now willing to lay their lives down in defense of the drug lords. We may strike quickly and expect only limited resistance, but some have suggested that we should use the Mordinos to demonstrate we are serious about our Old World values."

Since his return to freedom he has championed the ideals of the Enclave of old; Purity, Supremacy and the Re-establishment of America. Formerly involved in several secret projects during the Presidency of Dick Richardson-notably the FEV Experiments of Mariposa and the creation of Frank Horrigan-he seeks to finish what he and his colleagues started four decades ago: the eradication of the mutant menace that dares to tread upon American soil. When he was a young scientist, he distinguished himself as he... "

enc.11.t:0 "Anderson's Escape"
enc.11.d:0 "Whilst a slave, Anderson was kept from most physical labor duo to his knowledge of chemistry. Able to turn rudimentary scavenged items into poisons and bombs, he was deemed useful by his captors. Years later, when age started taking its toll on Anderson, they decided to bring him to New Reno, hoping the Mordinos would be interested in an old but chemically gifted slave. Much to their surprise, when the party neared New Reno, he..."

enc.16.d:0 "We are on the very borders of the NCR, a rogue nation occupying American soil. We can not deny that they would destroy us if they became fully aware of our existence. Luckily for us, the bear is blind. Weakened by bureaucracy, infighting and an ineffectual leader. With the right efforts made, we can hide under the very nose of the NCR until we are strong enough to reveal our plans. But we cannot keep them in the shadows forever, it will become harder and harder to conceal ourselves as time goes on."

The FEV in these vats contaminated beyond belief, they would not be suitable for our research.\n With more super mutants on their heels, our team must decide what to do quickly."
