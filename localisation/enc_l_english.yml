ERB_OWB_DESC: "Four decades ago Navarro was destroyed by NCR and Brotherhood forces in a joint strike to finish off the final bastion of the Enclave. Demoralized, leaderless and homeless, their remnants scattered to the wind, never to be seen again. At least that's what most believed.\n \n Under the nose of the sleeping NCR, Sargent Dornan has been working tirelessly to unite the Enclave remnants under his banner. Contacting the many hidden civilian bases of the Enclave to integrate a new generation of America's finest."

Anderson_desc:0 "Doctor Franklin is a former member of the Enclave's Chemical Corps and the current Enclave President.

Granite_desc:0 " Douglas Granite. Son of Sergeant George Granite and a California Caravaneer by the name of Molly, Douglas Granite represents the new Enclave. An Enclave dedicated to the rebuilding of America, and its ideals. Having grown up in the Wasteland amongst both children of the ECC his father once led, and the Wastelanders who they protect, he holds no illusions as to the perceived superiority of the "pure-blooded" over the majority of the Wasteland population. Indeed, due to the circumstances of his birth, he finds those that spout such rhetoric annoying at best, and dangerous at worst. Instilled with the ideals and stories of Old America by his Father, he dreams of the day when America is once again a reunited nation, from sea to shining sea with amber waves of grain and purple mountains majesty."
